>**“It's a win for our community, for urban farms [...] it’s a win for our city."**  

These are the hopeful praises of Charlotte, NC’s city council woman Dimple Ajmera in regards to a Carolina Farm Trust Project starting in Aldersgate, east Charlotte. The city is partnering with CFT to transform an unkempt seven acre lot into an urban farm for the nearby community. The farm will provide produce for the locals, and foster individual, city and state relationship building across socio-economic levels. It will also create learning space for schools and cooking classes as well as jobs for the farm managers. 

And this is just one example of the many benefits of local farming and food sourcing Carolina Farm Trust is developing. Our country’s standard of massive agricultural plots may be able to produce tons of food at a time, but they cannot match many of the following economic, environmental and social benefits gained from small-scale agriculture.
* **Flavor and nutrients**: Fresh local produce is picked at the peak of ripeness and has less time to travel to a farmer’s market or store, giving the consumer the most natural and robust flavor by minimizing nutrient loss from sitting in transit.
* **Local economy booster**: Buying local farmers and markets creates a shorter loop for cash flow, keeping money close to home by reinvesting it through other municipal businesses and services in your area. 
* **Safer foods**: By reducing the steps between you and your food’s source, the chance of contamination goes down. Local growers can control how the food is grown, harvested, washed and distributed without going through so many hands before reaching your table. [1][Klavinski, 2013]
* **Environmental health**: Farmland and greenspace our preserved with local food production as well as healthier soil practices by farmers, such as crop rotation and composting, decreased use of pesticides, herbicides or antibiotics, and biodiversity retention [2][Bowler, 2002]  
* **Community engagement and relationship building**: Getting to know local farmers and their products, as well as participating in community farming events is a great way to foster connections with your neighbors while supporting your health and the growth of local business. 

The mission of Carolina Farm Trust is to provide such benefits by connecting farmers to consumers and providing support to make sustainable food systems a reality. In the face of current agricultural efforts, most of the world’s 7 billion people still have poor diets [3][HSPH, 2018] and industrial agriculture is causing the majority of deforestation, freshwater usage, and marine species decline [4][Rockström, Willett & Stordalen, 2015]. But co-ops like Carolina Farm trust offer hope for smaller farms which reduces the need for clear-cutting, improves soil and air health, promotes local jobs and ensures the best quality food to consumers like you.

You can join the efforts of Carolina Farm Trust in creating local sustainable food systems by [Donating](https://carolinafarmtrust.org/donate/)  to keep farm partnerships thriving, as well as attending local farmers markets and events which can be found under the [Events](https://carolinafarmtrust.org/events/) tab on the home web page.
